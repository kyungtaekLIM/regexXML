# regexXML

`regexXML` provides python functions for parsing XML.
One can extract elements from XML by a tag name, and parse attributes of those elements with `regexXML`.
As python XML libaries such as `lxml` are extremely memory-demanding,`regexXML` will help parse very very big XML files in a memory-efficient manner.
